# haggadah

Copyright 2015 (c) William (Zev) Prahl

A (XeLaTeX) traditional passover haggadah with some original English translations.

To print the haggadah, first make sure that you have the following Hebrew fonts installed:

 - Cardo
 - Mekorot Rashi (http://mekorot.sourceforge.net)
 - Shlomo Stam and Semi-stam (https://sites.google.com/site/orlaeinayim/download)

Then, typeset the prahl_haggadah.tex file. This will create a pdf formatted on half-letter sized paper, and therefore easy to peruse on a digital device. To create a printout, then typeset the booklet.tex file, which will output a letter paper-formatted pdf that can be printed double sided (long-edge binding), folded and stapled to form a serviceable haggadah for use at the seder.

I *believe* this haggadah to be free of shemos (the explicit divine name), although it still includes the Hebrew word אלהים and its derivatives and the abbreviated name יה. It is my opinion that in such a state this haggadah does not require genizah, but if you and your halakhic authorities disagree, you should be cautious in printing this haggadah. 

I created this repository based on the haggadah I created for my 2015/5775 seder. It is now updated to the version I intend to use for my 2018/5778 seder.
