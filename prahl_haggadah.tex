% The Hebrew text used in the Haggadah is the nusakh ashkenaz text from he.wikitext.org, with the following modifications:
%  - the shemforash has been removed and replaced with יי wherever it occurs. יה and אלהינו have been left.
%  - benching follows the custom of the Vilna Gaon, based on Siddur Ezor Eliyhau
%  - wording of שוכן עד follows the order of nusah sefard/edus hamizrah, but with the ashkenaz words
% All English translations are original, although the "old JPS" TaNaKh translation from Mechon Mamre was occasionally used for reference.
